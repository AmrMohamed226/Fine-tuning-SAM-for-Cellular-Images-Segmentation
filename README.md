# Fine-tune-SAM-for-Cellular-Images-Segmentation

In this project, we go through the process of fine-tuning Meta AI’s Segment
Anything state-of-art model in segmentation tasks on EPFL’s Electron Mi-
croscopy Dataset, that contain cellular level images contacting mitochon-
dria and the respective segmentation masks, with the aim to direct the SAM
model to excel at the task of segmenting the mitochondria in the cellular im-
ages. We, therefore, go through the process of data preparation, fine-tuning
plan conception, loss functions and evaluation metrics choice, and finally,
model evaluation on a given test set.
