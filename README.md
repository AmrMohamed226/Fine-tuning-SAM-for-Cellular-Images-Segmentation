# Fine-tuning-SAM-for-Cellular-Images-Segmentation

In this project, we go through the process of fine-tuning Meta AI’s Segment
Anything state-of-art model in segmentation tasks on EPFL’s Electron Microscopy Dataset, that contain cellular level images contacting mitochondria and the respective segmentation masks, with the aim to direct the SAM
model to excel at the task of segmenting the mitochondria in the cellular images. We, therefore, go through the process of data preparation, fine-tuning plan conception, loss functions and evaluation metrics choice, and finally, model evaluation on a given test set.
